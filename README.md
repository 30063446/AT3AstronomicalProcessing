# AT3AstronomicalProcessing

This is a Windows Forms Application (C#/.NET) for recording and processing hourly neutrino interactions for a local observatory. The forms-based GUI application saves the data in an array of size 24 as integer values, displays the data in a list box, and uses the text boxes and buttons for processing. The main processing functions are binary search and bubble sort algorithms.
